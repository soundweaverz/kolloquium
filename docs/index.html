              <li>
                The more uniform the probability distribution, the higher the
                uncertainty.
              </li>
              <li>
                There is no uncertainty if the outcome of an event is known
                beforehand.

            <h3>Example: Road sign detection</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Detecting and correctly categorizing a road sign is very
                important for <em>full self-driving</em>
                cars.
              </li>
              <li>
                Miscategorizing road signs or misidentifying unrelated signs
                pose a real danger.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    This might be facilitated by a malicious actor (<em
